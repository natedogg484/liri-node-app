# liri-node-app
language responsive program

This program is meant to take in a typed user-input to generate data based on their search parameters.

First you (the user) will type in `node liri.js` and after that the input type you are going after.
 
Here are the inputs available to you when using this app!

* `concert-this`

* `spotify-this-song`

* `movie-this`

* `do-what-it-says`

When typing in `concert-this`, type in a band that you want to look up concerts for. If successfull it will look like this: `bands_capture.png`

When typing in `spotify-this-song`, type in a song that you want to look up information for. If successfull it will look like this: `spotify_capture.png`

When typing in `movie-this`, type in a move title that you want to look up information for. If successfull it will look like this: `omdb_capture.png`

When typing in `do-what-it-says`. You will get an automated response (this will also happen if nothing is typed in at all). If successfull it will look like this: `doWhatItSays.png`
